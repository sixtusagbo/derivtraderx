        <p>11.1 A cookie is a small piece of information that is placed on your computer when you visit certain websites.
            When we refer to “cookies” we include other technologies with similar purposes, such as tags and identifiers.
            Find out more about the use of cookies on <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com"
                target="_blank">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>
        <p>11.2 When you first visit our sites using a new browser, or if you visit in private browsing mode, we will
            provide you with a cookies permission banner seeking your consent to use of cookies as required by law. From
            this banner, you will be able to access our cookies management tool. By clicking OK or clicking through to any
            part of the site, we will start to manage your visit using cookies.</p>
        <p>11.3 We use the following types of cookie, as will your browser:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a) Analytics cookies that anonymously remember your computer or mobile device when you visit our website and
                recognize visits to our website across different devices. They keep track of browsing patterns and help us
                to build up a profile of how our readers use the website. We use that information for customer analytics and
                to serve advertisements that we think might be of particular interest to you on our and other websites. Your
                browser may use similar cookies for similar purposes and to serve advertisements for others.</li>
            <li>b) Service cookies that help us to make our website work as efficiently as possible; remember your
                registration and login details; remember your settings preferences; to detect what device you are using and
                adapt how we present our services according to the screen size of that device; and meter the number of pages
                you view for the purpose of administering subscriptions to primetraderx.com</li>
            <li>c) Third party advertising and analytics cookies, which are placed by or on behalf of independent
                advertisers who might advertising on our site. These cookies may be placed within the advertisement and
                elsewhere on our site by us or by your browser. They are anonymous – they cannot be used to identify
                individuals, but they can also allow the advertiser or your browser to tailor advertising to you when you
                visit other websites using the same browser. They are used for statistical analysis by allowing the
                advertiser to count how many people have seen their advertisement or have seen it more than once, to make
                sure you are not repeatedly served with the same advertising messages.</li>
            <li>d) We also place third party cookies to enable the serving of our own advertisements, for example, for our
                subscriptions offers, on other websites. These advertisements will be based on your browsing behavior on our
                website and will be tailored to your interests. The information we gather from your visit is limited to page
                URLs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>11.4 We have no access to third party cookies and third party organizations have no access to ours. The third
            party organizations that place cookies, including your browser (such as Google) and the third party companies
            who pay for advertising and analytics services using this information, will have their own privacy policies.</p>
        <p>11.5. Deleting cookies will have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.</p>
